# Artwork-Recommendation

We present a Artwork Recommendation System based which provides new artworks based on a visual clustering technique and user preferences, developed with sampled artworks from WikiArt datasets. The purpose of development of this Recommendation System is to verify whether a user's satisfaction increases when presented with artworks close to he or her taste. We also conducted a within-subjects experiment to validate the effect of preference based recommendation on a user's satisfaction on the recommended artwork sets.
