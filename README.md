# Artwork-Recommendation
We present an Artwork Recommendation System that provides new artworks based on a visual clustering technique and user preferences, developed with sampled artworks from WikiArt datasets. The purpose of the development of this Recommendation System is to verify whether a user's satisfaction increases when presented with artwork close to his or her taste. We also conducted a within-subjects experiment to validate the effect of preference-based recommendation on a user's satisfaction with the recommended artwork sets.
